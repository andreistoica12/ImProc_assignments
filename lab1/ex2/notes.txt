We ran our main experiment with the desired output range of [0,255],
however, the functionality allows to set any subset [min, max] of this range 
with 0 \leq min \leq max \leq 255.
### gradient
We observe that stretching does not really affect the output. This is because this
technique works well if the input image has a relatively small range of intensities.
Obviously, this is not true, since the entire range [0, 255] is covered by the original image.
As for the histogram equalization, conceptually this method is not very suitable in 
the gradient case, as the histogram is already flat.
### blurrymoon
This image is an interesting case, since very dark intensities are dominating, which is reflected
in the histogram of original image. Again, contrast stretching does not show a significant difference
and yields very similar histogram. If we consider histogram equalization, we can conclude that it 
leads to aquestionable 'enhancement'. The reason for that lies in a fact that this technique may increase the contrast 
where it was not needed (such as background noise or the fading part of the moon in our example). Since we were
comparing out output to built-in Matlab functions to ensure the correctness of our results, we observed that
histeq() provided a "washed-out" image. As explained in the book, this is due to the mapping a very narrow interval of dark pixels into the
upper end of the gray scale of the output image. Our result  differs in the sense that the background is still saturated, but the
artifact of "washed-out" part of the moon is present. This happens because we set up the range [0,255]. The identical to the built-in
function result can be achieved if this range is modified accordingly to [144, 255]. 
### peppers
This image was the most helpful for demonstration the results of contrast enhancement approaches. It still has a wide original range,
yet the upper limit is 230. As expected, contrast stretching enhanced highlights, as the range was expanded to 255. Therefore, the
histogram hasthe same shape as original, but as the name suggests, is uniformly stretched. Histogram equalization resulted in
more contrast image in general, where shadows are darker than in the input image. Obviously, we cannot expect to have a flat
histogram, but we definitely see that the values distrubution is a bit more equal among the intensity levels. 
To demostrate a different desired range for transformed image, we considered middle 50 levels (255/2 +- 25). The same differences
between contrast stretching and histogram equalization hold, but image is very grayinsh.
